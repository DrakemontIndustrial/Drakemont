## Step 1: Initial System Inspection

- [ ] Inspect physical components for wear, damage, or misalignment.
- [ ] Check fluid levels (e.g., hydraulic oil, coolant, lubrication) and replace/refill as necessary.
- [ ] Inspect electrical connections for corrosion, loose wiring, or damage.
- [ ] Verify functionality of safety systems, including pressure relief valves, emergency shutoffs, and interlocks.
- [ ] Examine mechanical fasteners (e.g., bolts, screws) for tightness and integrity.

---

## Step 2: System Performance Review

- [ ] Test all major system components, including PLCs, sensors, actuators, and motor drives.
- [ ] Check for any error codes, diagnostic messages, or system alarms.
- [ ] Monitor system performance metrics, such as power consumption, efficiency, and cycle times.
- [ ] Verify system communication between integrated components (e.g., field devices, SCADA, HMIs).
- [ ] Assess environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity) that may affect performance.
- [ ] Validate control logic and automation sequences for proper operation.

---

## Step 3: Troubleshooting (if applicable)

- [ ] Identify and document any detected faults, inconsistencies, or failures.
- [ ] Resolve identified problems (e.g., replace faulty sensors, recalibrate instruments, reprogram PLCs).
- [ ] Perform test runs and operational checks to confirm system stability and reliability.
- [ ] Investigate recurring issues and implement corrective actions to prevent future failures.
- [ ] Consult with client regarding any operational concerns or irregularities.

## Step 4: Preventative Maintenance Tasks

- [ ] Clean and lubricate moving parts to reduce wear and improve efficiency.
- [ ] Replace any worn-out or aging components, including seals, filters, belts, and bearings.
- [ ] Test backup systems, such as UPS units, emergency power supplies, and redundant controls.
- [ ] Update software/firmware if applicable, ensuring compatibility with existing hardware.
- [ ] Check system calibration and adjust settings to maintain peak performance.
- [ ] Perform vibration analysis and thermal imaging on critical components (if required).

---

## Step 5: Documentation and Client Report

- [ ] Provide client with a detailed maintenance report outlining all actions taken, including before-and-after performance data.
- [ ] Suggest any upgrades or improvements, such as integrating new technologies or optimizing existing processes.
- [ ] Document any recurring issues that may require long-term solutions or modifications.
- [ ] Set and confirm a schedule for the next maintenance check based on system requirements and client needs.
- [ ] Ensure the client understands key maintenance takeaways and best practices to sustain system performance.
