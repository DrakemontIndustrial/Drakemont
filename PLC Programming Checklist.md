## Step 1: Preliminary Assessment

- [ ] Gather detailed project requirements from the client
- [ ] Review existing PLC programs (if applicable)
- [ ] Identify specific I/O requirements, sensors, actuators, and other connected devices
- [ ] Determine the control strategy (e.g., PID, logic-based control, state machine)

---

## Step 2: Program Design

- [ ] Define inputs and outputs for the system
- [ ] Choose appropriate programming language (Ladder Logic, Structured Text, etc.)
- [ ] Develop flowcharts or diagrams to represent control logic
- [ ] Ensure compliance with clientâ€™s performance, safety, and regulatory requirements

---

## Step 3: Code Development

- [ ] Write the initial PLC code based on design specifications
- [ ] Implement fail-safe mechanisms and safety protocols (e.g., watchdog timers, alarms)
- [ ] Test code in a simulated environment (if possible)
- [ ] Develop comments within the code for future troubleshooting

---

## Step 4: System Integration & Testing

- [ ] Upload the PLC program to the system hardware
- [ ] Test the code on-site with actual devices
- [ ] Verify correct signal interpretation from sensors and actuators
- [ ] Ensure seamless communication between PLC and other connected systems (e.g., SCADA, HMI)

---

## Step 5: Troubleshooting & Optimization

- [ ] Check for bugs or issues with the code and fix them
- [ ] Optimize code for performance, efficiency, and response time
- [ ] Test the program under normal and extreme operating conditions
- [ ] Ensure all safety functions are operating correctly

---

## Step 6: Final Review & Client Approval

- [ ] Review the completed program with the client
- [ ] Conduct a final demonstration of the system in full operation
- [ ] Make any necessary adjustments based on client feedback
- [ ] Provide documentation for the PLC program (code, system flow, I/O mapping)
